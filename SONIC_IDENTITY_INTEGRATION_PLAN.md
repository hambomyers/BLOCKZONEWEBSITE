# Sonic Labs + Apple Pay + Player Identity Integration Plan

## **Overview**
Seamless integration of Apple Pay payments, Sonic Labs blockchain, and progressive player identity collection for BlockZone gaming platform.

## **Core User Experience Flow**

### **Stage 1: Anonymous Play**
- Player arrives, plays demo games immediately
- No friction, no signup required
- Temporary identity: "Anonymous Player" or "Guest"

### **Stage 2: Name Collection (Multiple Touch Points)**

#### **Touch Point A: Game Over Sequence**
**Trigger:** After 2-3 games when player is engaged
```
🎮 Game Over! Score: 15,420

"Great game! Want to save your high score and compete on leaderboards?"
[📝 Enter Your Name: ________________] [⏭️ Play Anonymous]

If name entered:
→ Identity becomes: "Mike" (stored locally)
→ "Welcome Mike! Your scores are now saved."
```

#### **Touch Point B: Academy Course Registration**
**Trigger:** Player clicks on any academy lesson
```
📚 "Computing & Binary Fundamentals"

"Want to track your progress through this course?"
[📖 Save My Progress] [👀 Browse Only]

If "Save Progress":
→ "What should we call you?" [Name field]
→ "Get course completion certificates?" [Email field - optional]
→ Creates education profile linked to gaming identity
```

### **Stage 3: Tournament Entry (Apple Pay Integration)**
**Trigger:** Player wants to enter paid tournaments
```
"Ready to compete for real prizes, Mike?"

Tournament Options:
• Single Game: $0.25
• Daily Pass: $2.50 (unlimited until midnight EST)

[🍎 Pay with Apple Pay]
```

**Apple Pay Flow:**
1. Native Apple Pay popup (Touch ID/Face ID)
2. Payment processed ($2.50)
3. Backend converts to USDC.e on Sonic Network
4. Auto-creates Sonic wallet for player
5. Player identity upgrades: Anonymous → Social

### **Stage 4: Wallet Identity Integration**
**After successful payment:**
```
"Welcome to crypto, Mike!"
"You now have USDC.e on Sonic Network"
"Your gaming identity: Mike#7f2a"
"Your Sonic wallet: 0x742a...7f2a"

[📱 Learn About Your Wallet] [🎮 Start Playing]
```

### **Stage 5: Prize Withdrawal (Full Web3 Integration)**
**When player wins prizes:**
```
"Congratulations Mike#7f2a! You won $1.85 in USDC.e!"

Withdrawal Options:
• Keep in Apple Pay account (custodial)
• Transfer to your Sonic wallet (self-custody)
• Cash out to bank account

[💰 Withdraw] [🎮 Play Again]
```
