$19.99 → 3000 quarters  (+500 bonus)
$49.99 → 7500 quarters  (+1500 bonus)

🎮 Game Costs
Tournament Entry: 25 quarters ($2.50 via odd conversion)
Daily Challenge: 5 quarters
```

### **✅ NEW SYSTEM (True Arcade Quarters)**
```
🪙 TRUE ARCADE ECONOMICS: 1 quarter = $0.25
$0.25  → 1 quarter      (Single Quarter)
$2.50  → 10 quarters + 1 bonus = 11 quarters (Roll of Quarters) ⭐ POPULAR
$10.00 → 40 quarters + 5 bonus = 45 quarters (Arcade Pack)

🎮 Game Costs
