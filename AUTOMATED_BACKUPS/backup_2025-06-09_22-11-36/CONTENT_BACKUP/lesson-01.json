                "A digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers",
                "A type of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin",

            ],
            "correct": 0,
            "explanation": "A blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that maintains a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are cryptographically linked and resistant to modification."

            "question": "What makes blockchain secure?",

            ],
            "correct": 1,
            "explanation": "Blockchain security comes from cryptographic hashing, which creates unique fingerprints for each block, and consensus mechanisms that require network agreement for changes."

            "question": "What is decentralization in blockchain?",
            "options": [
                "Having one central authority control everything",
                "Distributing control across multiple network participants",
                "Government regulation of all transactions",
                "Corporate oversight and management"
            ],
            "correct": 1,
            "explanation": "Decentralization means no single entity controls the network. Instead, control is distributed among many participants, making the system more resistant to censorship and failure."

        {
            "question": "What is a 'block' in blockchain?",
            "options": [
                "A physical storage device",
                "A group of transactions bundled together",

            "correct": 1,
            "explanation": "A block is a collection of transaction data that gets bundled together and added to the blockchain. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, creating the 'chain'."

            ],
            "correct": 1,
            "explanation": "Mining is the computational process where network participants (miners) compete to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain, earning rewards for their work."
