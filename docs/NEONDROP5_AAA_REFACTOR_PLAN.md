# NEONDROP5 - AAA Refactor Plan
# Technical Debt Resolution & Production Hardening

## PHASE 1: CSS Architecture Cleanup (Foundation)
- [ ] Audit all CSS files for conflicts and duplicates
- [ ] Implement CSS naming convention (BEM or similar)
- [ ] Create component-specific stylesheets with proper isolation
- [ ] Remove all broken/malformed CSS rules
- [ ] Establish CSS loading order hierarchy

## PHASE 2: Component Isolation (Modularity)
- [ ] Refactor leaderboard as truly independent component
- [ ] Implement proper event bus for component communication
- [ ] Add component lifecycle management
- [ ] Create standardized component interfaces

## PHASE 3: Testing Infrastructure (Quality Assurance)
- [ ] Unit tests for each game component
- [ ] Integration tests for UI flows
- [ ] Visual regression tests for CSS changes
- [ ] Performance monitoring and metrics

## PHASE 4: Build System (Professional Workflow)
- [ ] Asset bundling and minification
- [ ] CSS preprocessing with proper imports
- [ ] Development vs production configurations
- [ ] Automated deployment pipeline

## PHASE 5: Error Handling & Observability (Production Ready)
- [ ] Comprehensive error boundaries
- [ ] User-friendly error states
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Analytics and user behavior tracking

## IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Foundation First
Focus on Phase 1 - CSS Architecture. Everything else fails if the foundation is broken.

## SUCCESS METRICS
- Zero CSS conflicts or duplicate rules
- Component isolation verified
- 100% test coverage for critical paths
- Sub-100ms UI response times
- Zero production errors

This is how we build something that scales to millions of players.
