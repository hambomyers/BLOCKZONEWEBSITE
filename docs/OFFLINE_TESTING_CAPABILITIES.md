- Stats tracking ✅
- Local persistence ✅
- Anonymous→Social upgrade ✅

### 5. Central Coordination
- System initialization ✅
- Game lifecycle ✅
- Event coordination ✅

## 🌐 REQUIRES CONNECTION (OPTIONAL):

### 1. Backend API Calls
- Player registration (fails gracefully)
- Cloud synchronization (optional)

### 2. Web3 Features  
- Wallet connection (requires MetaMask)
- Sonic blockchain calls (requires network)

### 3. External Services
- IP geolocation (simulated offline)
- Real-time leaderboards (Phase 2)

## 🧪 TESTING RECOMMENDATION:

**CURRENT:** Test everything offline - all core systems work
**FUTURE:** Add connection-dependent features as enhancements

The Phase 1 implementation is designed to work fully offline 
with graceful degradation for online-only features.
