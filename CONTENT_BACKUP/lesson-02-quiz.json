      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Cypherpunks like Tim May, Nick Szabo, and Hal Finney believed cryptography is the ultimate tool for individual sovereignty and predicted its use in creating privacy technology."

      "options": [
        "It's faster",
        "It's cheaper to operate",
        "It's distributed and doesn't require trust in a central authority",
        "It has better user interfaces"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Unlike traditional databases controlled by single entities, blockchain is distributed across many computers and doesn't require trust in any central authority."
