    // Future: Universal card for all BlockZone interactions
    
    displayModes: [

        'leaderboard',   // Rankings and achievements  
        'profile',       // Social network identity
        'academy',       // Educational progress
        'teaching',      // Mentor dashboard
        'social'         // Community interactions
    ]
}
```

#### **Design Consistency**
