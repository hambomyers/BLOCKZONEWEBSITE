## 🛠️ IMPLEMENTATION HIGHLIGHTS

### **1. Advanced Architecture**
```javascript
// Unified system with dependency injection
const leaderboard = new UnifiedLeaderboard({
    enableRealtime: true,
    enableAntiCheat: true,
    maxPlayers: 1000,
    updateInterval: 1000
});

// Real-time updates with WebSocket
const socket = new LeaderboardSocket({
    enableOptimisticUpdates: true,
    autoReconnect: true,
    maxReconnectAttempts: 10
});

// Complete tournament management
const tournaments = new TournamentManager({
    enableAutoCreate: true,
    enablePrizeDistribution: true
});
```

### **2. Event-Driven Communication**
```javascript
// Unified event system across all components
leaderboard.on('scoreSubmitted', (data) => {
    socket.broadcastScoreUpdate(data.gameId, data);
    ui.updateScore(data.playerId, data.score, true);
});

socket.on('scoreUpdate', (data) => {
    ui.handleRealtimeScoreUpdate(data);
});
```

### **3. Cross-Game Normalization**
```javascript
// Fair scoring across different game types
function calculateCrossGameScore(gameId, score) {
    const normalizers = {
        'neon_drop': 1.0,        // Base game
        'block_puzzle': 0.8,     // Easier scoring
        'crypto_runner': 1.2     // Harder scoring
    };
    return Math.round(score * (normalizers[gameId] || 1.0));
}
```

### **4. Optimistic UI Updates**
```javascript
// Immediate feedback with server confirmation
ui.optimisticUpdate(playerId, newScore);
socket.sendScoreUpdate(scoreData, (confirmed) => {
    if (!confirmed) {
        ui.rollbackOptimisticUpdate(playerId);
    }
});
```
